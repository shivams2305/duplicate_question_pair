In this model I had did four things.

First one is in which I had just performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyse the datasset and modify it according to our requirements.

Then I go for a normal attempt to create the model without using any feature then use some of the basic features without any preprocessing then I go for the advance features of the dataset and use the preprocessing also to train the model properly and increasing the accuracy.
